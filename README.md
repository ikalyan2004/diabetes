Diabetes Prediction System
Diabetes is a chronic disease characterized by elevated blood glucose levels, which, if left untreated, can lead to severe health complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney damage, and nerve disorders. Detecting diabetes early is critical to managing the condition effectively and reducing the associated health risks. This project aims to develop a machine learning-based Diabetes Disease Prediction System using logistic regression, a supervised classification algorithm known for its robustness and efficiency in binary outcome predictions. The system leverages patient data to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals, allowing healthcare providers and patients to take proactive measures.
The primary dataset used in this project is the PIMA Indians Diabetes Database, which includes various health indicators such as age, BMI (Body Mass Index), blood pressure, number of pregnancies, glucose concentration, insulin levels, diabetes pedigree function, and skin thickness. Each of these parameters is crucial for diabetes diagnosis, contributing significantly to the prediction model. The "Diabetes Pedigree Function," in particular, quantifies the likelihood of diabetes based on genetic factors, while other parameters provide information on the patient's current health condition.
To build an accurate and reliable model, the dataset undergoes a series of preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, data normalization, and splitting into training and test sets. The logistic regression model is then trained on the processed data to establish relationships between input variables and the probability of a diabetes diagnosis. Performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are used to evaluate the model. Logistic regression was selected for its simplicity and interpretability, providing a probability score that helps quantify the model's confidence in its predictions.
In addition to logistic regression, we explored other machine learning algorithms, including Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forests, to compare their accuracy and suitability for diabetes prediction. Our analysis shows that logistic regression offers a competitive performance, especially with hyperparameter tuning and data scaling, but other algorithms like Random Forests may yield slightly higher accuracy at the expense of interpretability
The final system is designed with user interaction in mind. Users can input patient health information directly into the model, which then outputs a prediction indicating whether the patient is likely to have diabetes. This user-friendly design allows for real-time assessments, making it a valuable tool for preliminary screenings and personal health monitoring.
